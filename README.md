## Light Driving School

Light driving school
Design and develop a comprehensive online driving school platform aimed at facilitating student registration, course enrollment, and access to interactive learning materials. The platform should empower administrative staff to seamlessly add modules, lessons, and quizzes. Each lesson should support diverse content types such as videos, text, or audio, and modules may contain multiple lessons. Additionally, students should be able to take lessons and associated quizzes to gauge their comprehension. The system should allow users to resume previously unfinished lessons, ensuring a continuous learning experience. Furthermore, administrators should have efficient tools for managing course content. Upon course completion, the system should generate a certificate for the student.
Additional Functionality:
1.	User Profile Management: Allow students and staff to create and manage their profiles, including personal information and course progress tracking.
2.	Discussion Forums: Implement discussion forums where students can engage in discussions, ask questions, and share experiences related to the course content.
3.	Progress Tracking: Provide comprehensive tracking of student progress, including completed lessons, quiz scores, and overall course completion percentage.
4.	Notification System: Incorporate a notification system to alert users about new course materials, upcoming quizzes, and important announcements.
5. Feedback Mechanism: Enable students to provide feedback on courses, lessons, and quizzes to improve the overall learning experience.
